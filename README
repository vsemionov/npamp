------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numerical model of a laser amplifier for pulse trains, accounting for amplified spontaneous emission and finite lower state lifetime
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview
========
NPAmp is an implementation of a numerical model of a laser amplifier. It is designed for practical and educational purposes.

Mathematical Model Features
---------------------------
* Describes the propagation of single pulses or pulse trains in a laser amplifier.
* Accounts for the amplified spontaneous emission during pumping.
* Accounts for the finite lower state lifetime during amplification.

Numerical Model Features
------------------------
* Produces physically consistent and, where possible, numerically stable results.
* Automatic determination of the discretization parameter domain, based on specified numerical error tolerances of the individual intermediate results.
* Automatic selection of the most efficient combination of employed numerical methods, based on physical consistency, numerical stability, and error tolerance criteria.

Implementation Features
-----------------------
* Parallel computing -- performs calculations concurrently, on multiple CPU cores, where possible.
* Cross-platform -- supports Windows, Linux, BSD, OS X, etc.
* Flexible and configurable operation -- most computations can be selectively enabled, their input parameters adjusted, and their outputs customized.
* Computes a wide variety of results.
* Generates publication-quality, customizable graphs.
* Extensible through Python modules.
* Easy to use graphical user interface.
* Command-line interface, which facilitates the automation of research.
* Freely distributable under the terms of the BSD license.

Characteristics of the Modeled Amplifier and Input Signal
---------------------------------------------------------
* The amplifier is single-pass.
* The active medium is solid-state, four-level, with cylindrical geometry.
* The pumping is pulsed, homogeneous, and its optical power is a rectangular function of time.
* The gain medium has a diffuse side surface and is water-cooled.
* There are no significant temperature gradients and mechanical stresses inside the gain medium.
* The laser beam, propagating in the amplifier, is collimated.
* The input signal enters the amplifier immediately after the pumping; its power is null beforehand.
* The input signal consists of either a single pulse or a finite-length train of equally-separated in time pulses with arbitrary, but uniform, spatial and temporal shapes.
* The signal's frequency spectrum width is much smaller than its carrier frequency.
* The signal's total duration is much shorter than the upper state lifetime.
* The signal's optical intensity is proportional to both its power and its fluence.
* The time between the completion of an amplification and the start of the subsequent pumping is much longer than the upper state lifetime.
* During pumping, population inversion does not change significantly in the transit time of the amplifier.
* Pump band population is negligible; ground state population is much greater than the sum of the laser state populations; nonradiative transitions, originating from the upper state, can be neglected; the frequency dependence of the upper state stimulated emission cross section can be neglected.
* During amplification, spontaneous emission is negligible; absorption and scattering losses of signal radiation are negligible; the transit time of the amplifier is much shorter than the upper state lifetime.


Installation
============

Windows
-------
The recommended way of installing NPAmp on Windows is to download and run the provided installer.

Unix
----
On Unix, NPAmp needs to be built from source. First, the required build and runtime dependencies need to be present and accessible on the system. The required packages, and their tested versions, are:
* python (2.7.3)
* cython (0.15.1)
* numpy (1.6.1)
* scipy (0.9.0)
* matplotlib (1.1.1)
* pyside (1.1.0)
* make (3.81)
* C compiler (gcc 4.6.3)
Next, extract the source archive into the target directory, and run ``make`` inside that directory. The executables are <target>/npamp/npamp.py and <target>/npamp/gnpamp.py, where <target> is the path to the target directory.


Operation
=========
NPAmp has a graphical interface (GNPAmp) and a command-line interface (NPAmp).

The model accepts a set of physical, numerical, operational and output parameters. These parameters can optionally be written to and loaded from configuration files. 

There are two different modes of operation -- basic mode and extended mode. In basic mode, results are computed only for fixed values of the input parameters. In extended mode, results are computed for different values of various input parameters. This facilitates the studying of the effects of various parameters on the results.

Basic Mode
----------
The most important results, currently computed in basic mode, are:

* pumping

 + numerical results:

  - pump energy
  - final population inversion
  - final small signal gain 
  - final stored energy

 + graphical results:

  - temporal evolution of population inversion

* amplification

 + numerical results:

  - input energy
  - output energy
  - energy gain
  - extraction efficiency
  - optical to optical efficiency
  - maximum output fluence
  - relative gain reduction (difference between the gain of the first and last pulses, divided by the gain of the first pulse)

 + graphical results:

  - energy gain of individual pulses in the train
  - longitudinal and temporal evolution of upper and lower state population, population inversion and photon density
  - longitudinal evolution of the signal's fluence
  - temporal shape of input and output photon density
  - radial shape of the input and output fluence
  - transverse shape of the input and output fluence

Extended Mode
-------------
The following computations are currently performed in extended mode:

* effects of lower state lifetime on the temporal shape and fluence of a pulse

 + computed results:

  - output fluence for zero, finite, and infinite lifetimes
  - photon density evolution for the above lifetimes

* optimization of the amplifier:

 + optimized parameters:

  - pumping system parameters -- pump power and duration
  - geometry parameters -- active medium diameter and input beam diameter

 + maximized output characteristics:

  - output energy
  - energy gain
  - extraction efficiency
  - optical to optical efficiency

 + minimized output characteristics:

  - relative gain reduction

 + imposed restrictions:

  - limited effect of ASE on population inversion during pumping
  - limited maximum output fluence (under the damage threshold)

 + most important computed results:

  - values of the set of optimized parameters, for which the output characteristics are minimal/maximal, while all restrictions are met
  - constraints on the domain of the set of optimized parameters
  - dependence of the following quantities on the optimized parameters: pump energy, population inversion, small signal gain, stored energy, effect of ASE on population inversion, input energy, output energy, energy gain, extraction efficiency, optical to optical efficiency, maximum output fluence

Execution
---------
The most important parameters, governing the execution of the model, are:
* parameter 1


Extensions
==========
NPAmp is extensible through Python modules. To install an extension module:
1. Create the <home>/.npamp/extensions directory, if it doesn't exist, where <home> is the path to your home directory.
2. Copy the extension module to the above directory.
3. Restart any running instances of NPAmp or GNPAmp.
For an example of an extension and a configuration which utilizes it, see examples/sawtooth_pulse.py and examples/extensions.npc, respectively, in the installation directory.
To view the list of currently installed extensions in the the graphical interface, use "About NPAmp" from the Help menu.
