Characteristics of the Modeled Amplifier and Input Signal
---------------------------------------------------------
* The amplifier is single-pass.
* The active medium is solid-state, four-level, with cylindrical geometry.
* The pumping is pulsed, homogeneous, and its optical power is a rectangular function of time.
* The active medium has a diffuse side surface and is water-cooled.
* There are no significant temperature gradients and mechanical stresses inside the active medium, therefore it is homogeneous.
* The active medium's temperature, and therefore its refractive index, is constant in time.
* The laser beam, propagating in the amplifier, is collimated.
* The input signal enters the amplifier immediately after the pumping; its power is null beforehand.
* The input signal consists of either a single pulse or a finite-length train of equally-separated in time pulses with arbitrary, but uniform, spatial and temporal shapes.
* The signal's frequency spectrum width is much smaller than its carrier frequency.
* The signal's total duration is much shorter than the upper state lifetime.
* The signal's optical intensity is proportional to its power and fluence.
* The time between an amplification and the subsequent pumping is much longer than the upper state lifetime.
* During pumping, population inversion does not change significantly in the transit time of the amplifier.
* The pump band has a lifetime, much shorter than the upper state lifetime, and therefore its population is negligible; ground state population is much larger than the sum of the laser state populations, and is therefore constant in time; nonradiative transitions, originating from the upper state, can be neglected; the frequency dependence of the stimulated emission cross section of the laser transition can be neglected.
* During amplification, spontaneous emission is negligible; the transit time of the amplifier is much shorter than the upper state lifetime; absorption and scattering losses of signal radiation are negligible.


Installation
============

Windows
-------
The recommended way of installing NPAmp on Windows is to download and run the provided installer.

Unix
----
On Unix, NPAmp needs to be built from source. First, the required build and runtime dependencies need to be present and accessible on the system. The required packages, and their tested versions, are:

* python (2.7.3)
* cython (0.15.1)
* numpy (1.6.1)
* scipy (0.9.0)
* matplotlib (1.1.1)
* pyside (1.1.0)
* make (3.81)
* C compiler (gcc 4.6.3)

Next, extract the source archive into the target directory, and execute ``make`` inside that directory. The executables are <target>/npamp/npamp.py and <target>/npamp/gnpamp.py, where <target> denotes the path to the target directory.


Operation
=========
NPAmp has a graphical interface (GNPAmp) and a command-line interface (NPAmp).

The model accepts a set of physical, numerical, operational, and output parameters. All of these parameters can be adjusted through the graphical interface. The parameters can optionally be written to and loaded from configuration files. 

There are two different modes of operation -- basic mode and extended mode. In basic mode, results are computed only for fixed values of the input parameters. In extended mode, results are computed for different values of various parameters. This facilitates the studying of the effects of these parameters on the results.


Basic Mode
----------
The most important results, currently computed in basic mode, are:

* pumping stage:

 + numerical results:

  - pump energy
  - final population inversion
  - final small signal gain 
  - final stored energy

 + graphical results:

  - temporal evolution of population inversion

* amplification stage:

 + numerical results:

  - input energy
  - output energy
  - energy gain
  - extraction efficiency
  - optical to optical efficiency
  - maximum output fluence
  - relative gain decrease (the difference between the gain of the first and last pulses, divided by the gain of the first pulse)

 + graphical results:

  - energy gain of individual pulses in the train
  - longitudinal and temporal evolution of upper state population, lower state population, population inversion, and photon density
  - longitudinal evolution of the signal's fluence
  - temporal shape of the input and output photon density
  - radial shape of the input and output fluence
  - transverse shape of the input and output fluence


Extended Mode
-------------
The following computations are currently performed in extended mode:

* effects of lower state lifetime on the temporal shape and fluence of the pulse

 + computed results:

  - output fluence for zero, finite, and infinite lifetimes
  - photon density evolution for the above lifetimes

* comparison of various ASE models:

 + most important computed results:

  - population inversion and depopulation rate immediately after pumping, for each model
  - temporal evolution of population inversion and depopulation rate during pumping, for all models
  - dependence of depopulation rate on population inversion, for all models
  - temporal evolution of the relative difference between the population inversion, yielded by the compared models and by a reference model (example use: evaluation of the effect of ASE on population inversion by comparing results from ASE and fluorescence models)

* amplifier optimization:

 + optimized sets of parameters:

  - pumping system -- pump power and pump duration
  - geometry -- active medium diameter and input beam diameter

 + maximized output characteristics:

  - output energy
  - energy gain
  - extraction efficiency
  - optical to optical efficiency

 + minimized output characteristics:

  - relative gain decrease

 + imposed restrictions:

  - limited effect of ASE on population inversion during pumping
  - limited maximum output fluence (under the damage threshold)

 + most important computed results:

  - values of the optimized set of parameters, for which the output characteristics are extremal, while all restrictions are met
  - constraints on the domain of the set of optimized parameters
  - dependence of the following quantities on the set of optimized parameters: pump energy, population inversion, small signal gain, stored energy, effect of ASE on population inversion, input energy, output energy, energy gain, extraction efficiency, optical to optical efficiency, maximum output fluence


Execution
---------
The most important parameters, affecting the execution of the model, are:

* extended mode: enables extended mode; see above
* initial inversion: specifies the initial population inversion for the amplification stage; if non-zero, pumping-stage inversion will not be computed
* perform amplification: specifies whether amplification-stage computations will be performed
* generate graphs: enables the generation of result graphs


Practical Use
=============

ASE Models
----------
Of all implemented depopulation models, the Ross ASE model accounts for the effects of the highest number of contributing factors, and is expected to yield the most accurate results. In the graphical interface, this model is labeled as "RossApproximateASEModel", and is selected by default.

Numerical Parameters
--------------------
In many cases, the default values of the numerical parameters (in the Numerics tab of the graphical interface) are an acceptable compromise between accuracy and efficiency. In the absence of specific requirements, these parameters do not need to be modified.

In cases when examination of the temporal or spatial evolution of the computed quantities is required, the minimum numbers of discretization steps may need adjustment in order to increase the smoothness of the generated graphs.


Extensions
==========
NPAmp is extensible by means of Python modules. To install an extension module:

1. Create the <home>/.npamp/extensions directory, if it doesn't exist, where <home> denotes the path to the user's home directory.
2. Copy the extension module to the above directory.
3. Restart any running instances of NPAmp or GNPAmp.

For an example of an extension and a configuration which uses it, see examples/sawtooth_pulse.py and examples/extensions.npc, respectively, in the installation directory.
To view the list of currently installed extensions in the graphical interface, use "About NPAmp" from the Help menu.


Common Problems
===============
* Warnings in the output. In some cases, NPAmp may issue warnings about exceeding the maximum numbers of discretization steps while trying to ensure the required accuracy. If this occurs during the pumping-stage calculations, a possible solution is to select a different inversion method. For amplification-stage computations, NPAmp probes all combinations of the selected integration and amplification methods and chooses the most efficient combination (requiring the least total number of discretization steps). Therefore, it is possible that the warnings are related to a method combination which will not actually be used, and therefore computations may still be performed with the required accuracy. To verify this, enable verbose output to check which method combination causes the warnings, and/or select different (sets of) integration and amplification methods. In cases of extreme values of physical or numerical parameters, all method combinations may require unreasonably large numbers of discretization steps. In that case, the only solution is to reduce the required accuracy.
* Unordered progress status numbers in the output. In some cases, when computations are performed in parallel, the reported status may be unordered. This is normal and does not affect the results.
