Numerical model of a laser amplifier for pulse trains, accounting for amplified spontaneous emission and finite lower state lifetime
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Overview
========
NPAmp is an implementation of a numerical model of a laser amplifier.
It is designed for practical and educational purposes.

Mathematical Model Features
---------------------------
* Describes the propagation of single pulses or pulse trains in a laser amplifier.
* Accounts for the amplified spontaneous emission during pumping.
* Accounts for the finite lower state lifetime during amplification.

Numerical Model Features
------------------------
* Produces physically consistent and, where possible, numerically stable results.
* Automatic determination of the discretization parameter domain, based on specified numerical error tolerances of the individual intermediate results.
* Automatic selection of the most efficient combination of employed numerical methods, based on physical consistency, numerical stability, and error tolerance criteria.

Implementation Features
-----------------------
* Parallelism - performs calculations concurrently, on multiple CPU cores, where possible.
* Cross-platform - supports all major modern operating systems (Windows, Linux, BSD, OS X, etc.).
* Produces a wide variety of results.
* Flexible and configurable operation.
* Generates customizable, publication-quality graphics; writes graph data.
* Extensible through Python modules.
* Easy to deploy with a single-file installer (on Windows).
* Easy to use graphical user interface.
* Command-line interface, which facilitates the automation of research.
* Freely distributable under the terms of the BSD license, completely free of charge.

Characteristics of the Modeled Amplifier and Input Signal
---------------------------------------------------------
* The amplifier is single-pass.
* The active medium is four-level, solid-state, with cylindrical geometry.
* The pumping is pulsed, homogeneous, and its optical power is a rectangular function of time.
* The gain medium has a diffuse side surface and is water-cooled.
* There are no significant temperature gradients and mechanical stresses inside the gain medium.
* The laser beam, propagating in the amplifier, is collimated.
* The input signal enters the amplifier immediately after the pumping; its power is null beforehand.
* The input signal consists of either a single pulse or a finite-length train of equally-spaced in time pulses with arbitrary, but uniform, spatial and temporal shapes.
* The signal's frequency spectrum width is much less than its carrier frequency.
* The signal's total duration is much less than the upper state lifetime.
* The signal's optical intensity is proportional to both its power and its fluence.
* The time between the completion of an amplification and the start of the subsequent pumping is much longer than the upper state lifetime.
* Pump-band population is negligible; ground state population is much greater than the sum of the laser state populations; nonradiative transitions, originating from the upper state, can be neglected; the frequency dependence of the upper state's stimulated emission cross section can be neglected.
* Spontaneous emission during amplification is negligible; absorption and scattering losses are negligible; transit time of the amplifier is much shorter than the upper state lifetime.
* Population inversion does not change significantly in the transit time of the amplifier during pumping.
