Overview
========
NPAmp is an implementation of a numerical model of a laser amplifier.
It is designed for practical and educational purposes.

Mathematical Model Features
---------------------------
* Describes the propagation of pulse trains in a laser amplifier.
* Accounts for the amplified spontaneous emission during pumping.
* Accounts for the finite lower state lifetime during amplification.

Numerical Model Features
------------------------
* Produces physically consistent and, where possible, numerically stable results.
* Automatic determination of the discretization parameter domain, based on specified numerical error tolerances of individual intermediate results.
* Automatic selection of the most efficient combination of employed numerical methods, based on physical consistency, numerical stability, and error tolerance criteria.
